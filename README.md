# miceandmaze
![alt text](android/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xhdpi/ic_launcher.png)

A simple game I wrote as part of a one/two week coding challenge on the side (while working and studying).
The app still has some minor issues and the code could be a bit more organised but all in all it was a fun 
challenge and good way to really get started with flutter. 

# How the game works

You are in control of the maze while the mouse character moves on it's own. Change the maze by swiping the walls into different places to avoid the evil rat/traps and get the cheese.
